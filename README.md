# Planner and Scheduler
## 05 Third Party Work Day Scheduler

This was a difficult homework, due to a family emergency this caused me to fall behind however I was able to construct a readable planner. 

## Requirements

<!-- ----------------------- -->
 Bootstrap used 4.3.1 and jQuery 3.2.1
 Create time blocks and get them dynamically 
 Saved data/local storage
 
Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Configuration

<!-- ----------------------- -->
Saves data entered in feilds when the save button gets selected so when the user refreashes
the page the data is either saved or not depenind if the button was used. 


## Troubleshooting
I had turned this in incomplete due to being behind. Life happens(family member was sent to the ICU)
I had time to think and reflect and instead of storing the data individually I grouped the data and had it 
recall all of them at once to minimize the lines and lines of code.
Syntax still very tricky.


<!-- ----------------------- -->
Git hub servers where down, the git add . and the git push couldnt be updated with changed

### Recources
